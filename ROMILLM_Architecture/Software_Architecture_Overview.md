## 🏛️ Architecture Principles

### Separation of Concerns
Each layer has a single, well-defined responsibility with minimal overlap between layers.

### Dependency Direction
Dependencies flow downward - higher layers depend on lower layers, never the reverse.

### Testability First
Every layer is designed to be testable in isolation with appropriate mocking strategies.

### Performance by Design
Architecture decisions prioritize performance while maintaining clean abstractions.

### Immutable by Default
Prefer immutability where possible, especially in stateless layers.
